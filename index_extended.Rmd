## What is it?
### {[tldr: "inline metadata"]}
<br />
mBraceSquare is a markup language used to represent metadata in regular text using familiar JSON/CSON syntax

    {[ key: "value" ]}
    
### Example
<pre>> cat ~/student_essays/jimmys_superhero.txt

when I grow up, I want to be big and strong like #JohnCena.

> cat ~/student_essays/jimmys_superhero_corrections.txt

when I grow up, I want to be big and strong like John Cena {[comment: "I know it sounds
cool Jimmy, but please don't use hashtags in your essays."]}.</pre>

## Design Goals
### {[tldr: ['legible', 'intuitive', 'tolerant'] ]}
<br />
mBraceSquare was designed to provide a simple way of representing loosely structured (meta)data in regular text.

<br />
Implementations of mBraceSquare should be:

- easy to read and interpret

<br />
- intuitive to write

<br />
- tolerant of human laziness

## Use Cases

<br />
mBraceSquare is flexible and can be used in many different contexts

### Informal Context

## Use Cases

### Formal Context

<br />
Authoring in Markdown is great and being able to easily add _microdata_ would be cool.

### Insert Microdata

<pre> > cat /srv/http/www.cip.li/blog/_posts/2014-06-06-ilmenau_himmel_blau.markdown

I was in Ilmenau visiting some friends on the weekend and we had a great time! We rented
some donkeys from a {[localBusiness: "Esel und Söhne"]} and rode to the top of the Kickelhahn.

## Use Cases
### {[tldr: "custom macros"]}
<br />
Being able to add custom macros in order to extend markdown could also be useful

### Simple Commands

<pre> > cat /srv/http/www.cip.li/blog/_posts/2014-12-22-in_comes_mbracesquare.markdown

So, it's {[date: "currentYear"]} and you may be thinking to yourself, seriously? Do we
really need another Markup language, we already have XML, YAML, HTML, [A-Z]*ML...
</pre>
